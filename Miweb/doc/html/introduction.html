<p class="P5">
	The Mountain Island Media Center (Media Center) was developed for the purpose of organizing and displaying digital media to projectors and/or television screens supporting computer connected inputs such as VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc. This user manual describes the operation of the program as well as maintaining the generated material produced by the program.
</p>
<p class="P5">
	The user interface for the program was designed to facilitate a simple work flow for worship media display during services of the church. Primarily, hymns and scripture texts are displayed to supplement hymn book and Bible content. The typical work flow starts on the Search notebook tab, illustrated by the <img style="height:13px;" src="../image/search_tab_icon.png" alt="Search Tab Icon"> icon. A hymn is selected using the controls on the Search page, and the work flow procedes toward the right side of the Search page, until the hymn is arranged in the far right list box. Finally, the selected hymn content is generated and subsequently directed to display on media devices such as TVs, or projectors.
</p>
<p class="P_INSET">
	Plan to run the Media Center on your primary monitor. This is because the primary monitor is almost never broadcast to a projection screen or display TV, and presentations will automatically be displayed on a secondary screen. This scenario enables the Media Center to continue to be used while a presentation is being displayed. Practice with it, and you'll develop your own way of using the Media Center to its fullest potential in your environment.

<p class="P5">
	One of the most common tasks is to select a hymn to display to a projector or TV. The first step is to select the book (or database) to which the song belongs. This is accomplished by using the <a href="search.html#HYMNBOOK">Hymn Book Collection List</a> shown in the illustration above. Once the hymn book (database) is selected, a hymn can be selected from the <a href="search.html#HYMNLIST">Hymn List</a> located immediately below the dropdown box. When a hymn is double-clicked, 3 things happen simultaneously:<br>
	<ol type="1" class="P5">
		<li>The hymn meta-data is displayed in the box below the selected hymn, and</li>
		<li>The Song parts list is filled with the names of the songs (e.g. Verse 1, Verse 2, Chorus, etc.)</li>
		<li>If there is only one hymn in the parts list, the song parts will automatically be arranged in the <a href="arranger.html#ARRANGER">Arranger</a> list box in a common order, closely matching hymn book suggestions. The <a href="arranger.html#ARRANGER">Arranger</a> list box is located at the far right side of the Search page.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	Usually the next step is to press the <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/to_organizer_button.png" alt="Generate Presentation" onclick="window.location.href = 'organizer.html';"> (Generate Presentation) button, which will generate a presentation file containing all of the song part images in the order they are listed in the <a href="arranger.html#ARRANGER">Arranger</a> list box. The program will automatically switch the notebook tab to display the <a href="organizer.html#ORGANIZER">Organizer</a>.
	<img style="display: block; width: 60%; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 10px;" ALIGN="left" alt="" src="../image/organizer_top.png"/>
	The image at left shows the <a href="organizer.html#ORGANIZER">Organizer</a> after some hymn presentation files have been generated. Double-clicking a presentation file will start the LibreOffice Impress application, which will load the presentation file, and display it in full-screen mode. There are additional features of the <a href="arranger.html#ARRANGER">Arranger</a> that can be used to customize the generated hymn presentation file.

	<span class="P3" id="DISPLAY_STEPS" style="color: #004;">A concise summary of the normal work flow for displaying a hymn is:</span>

	 	<li>Select a database source from the Search Hymn Collections.</li>
	 	<li>Double-click a hymn in the Search listbox located just below the Search Hymn Collections.</li>
