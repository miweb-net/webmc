	The Media Center provides a means for deleting a hymn that was added to a database (book) that doesn't belong in the database. If you use this maintenance feature, please be careful as hymn deletions are permanent. This means that the deleted hymn will no longer be available for use in the Media Center.
</p>
<p class="P5">
	Occassionally a hymn must be deleted from a database because of any number of reasons. The most common are associated with the <a href="importer.html">Importer</a>, which is the utility provided by the Media Center to insert a hymn into a database. Here are the most common reasons for deleting a hymn from a database:
	<ul>
		<li>Imported hymn into an incorrect database.</li>
		<li>Information associated with a hymn was typed incorrectly.</li>
		<li>Hymn page mapping (mapping images to verses) was improper.</li>
		<li>A hymn's copyright does not allow the church to project it.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p class="P5">
	If any of these reasons apply, it is probably necessary to use the delete feature, but ordinarily you should avoid using this function. It is an advanced feature that is meant to be used by personnel using the <a href="importer.html">Importer</a> (another advanced feature of the Media Center).
</p>

<p class="P5">
	Deleting a hymn is a simple operation:
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to the Search page by clicking on the <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/search_tab_icon.png" alt="Search Tab Icon"> icon just below the menu.</li>
		<li>Select the database using the <a href="#HYMNBOOK">Hymn Book Dropdown</a></li>
		<li>Find the song in the hymn listbox and click once on it to select it.</li>
		<li>Click on the Edit &gt; Delete menu item.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	At this step, a confirmation dialog will be displayed to ensure that you intend to permanently delete the hymn from the database. <img style="display: block; width: 61%; padding: 10px; margin: 0 auto;" src="../image/delete_hymn_confirm.png" alt="Delete Hymn Confirmation Dialog">
