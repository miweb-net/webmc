<img style="display: block; height: auto; width: 85%; padding: 10px; word-wrap:none;" ALIGN="center" alt="" src="../image/organizer.png"/>
<p class="P5">
	The organizer displays all of the generated presentation files created by the Media Center as well as those copied to the presentations subfolders using a file manager or command line utility. When the Media Center is started, it reads the hymns, scriptures, and other subdirectories to load existing content into the Organizer. Each of these 3 distinct presentation file types is represented by a specific icon related to its type. These icons that represent them enable distinguishing the type of presentation file at a glance.
</p>
<p class="P5">The three recognized types are:
	<ul style="list-style:none;">
		<li><img style="height:35px; width:4%" src="../image/hymnal.png" alt="Music Presentations"/> Music files (hymns)</li>
		<li><img style="height:35px; width:4%" src="../image/bible.png" alt="Bible Presentations"/> Bible text files (scriptures)</li>
		<li><img style="height:35px; width:4%" src="../image/presentation.png" alt="Other Presentations"/> Other Presentation files (.pptx extension)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	One special case involves the creation of hymn <a href="arranger.html#MEDLEY_OVERVIEW">medleys</a> -- 2 or more hymns combined to make one hymn. These icons are identified by the word 'Medley', followed by the hymn <i>numbers</i> that comprise the song. Also, if the mouse is hovered over the icon, the titles of the individual hymns combined to make the medley will be displayed in a small tool tip window near the icon and mouse pointer. See the <a href="medley100_101.html#GENERATE">medley example</a> for an illustration of this effect.
</p>
<p id="REFRESH">
	<span class="P3">Refresh the Presentation List</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	The Media Center presentation list can be updated at any time by pressing the Organizer <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/organizer_tab.png" alt="Switch To Organizer View"> tab, which is located above the Organizer window. This feature is useful when a presentation file has been copied or moved from one folder to another, provided the new location is in a presentations subfolder. The Media Center does not periodically reread the presentations subfolders to find new or copied presentation files. It does recognize when new hymn or scripture presentation files are generated by the Media Center, and it also scans the presentations subfolders on startup.
</p>
<p id="GENERATE">
	<span class="P3">Create Hymn/Scripture Presentations</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	Hymn and Scripture presentations can be automatically  generated and sent to the Organizer using the Media Center. Hymn presentations are generated by pressing the <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/to_organizer_button.png" alt="Show In Organizer" onclick="window.location.href = 'arranger.html';"> button in the <a href="arranger.html">Arranger</a>. Bible scripture presentations generated when button with the same icon is pressed <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/to_organizer_button.png" alt="Show In Organizer" onclick="window.location.href = 'editor.html';"> within the <a href="editor.html">Scripture Editor</a>. Of course, the Organizer can be manually viewed by pressing the <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/organizer_tab.png" alt="Switch To Organizer View"> tab (located above the Organizer) at any time.
</p>
<p id="REORDER">
	<span class="P3">Change Order of Presentations</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	The Organizer provides standard drag and drop capabilties for organizing presentations in a particular order. To move an icon "ahead" of another one in the Organizer sequence, click the left mouse button and keep holding it down while you drag the item on top of the presentation it should precede. Once the mouse button is released, the drag will be complete and the icon will visually appear at the location at which it was dragged. The presentation sequence can be arranged in any order desired. When the program exits, it will save the order of presentation files as they appear in the Organizer, unless the preferences have been configured to remove the files in folder(s) on exit. The program saves the order of the remaining files so that when the program is restarted, they will appear in the Organizer in the same order as before program exit.
</p>
<p id="DISPLAY">
	<span class="P3">Display a Presentation</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	A presentation file is displayed by double-clicking its icon, or selecting the icon (single-click) and pressing the &lt;Enter&gt; key on the keyboard. As soon as one of these two methods of displaying the presentation file is executed, Libre Impress is launched to display the contents of the file. All control of the pages being displayed to the screen are managed through Libre Impress. Note that MIMC is still running even while the presentation is being displayed on screen(s).
</p>
<p id="DELETE">
	<span class="P3">Delete/Remove a Presentation</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	The Media Center will delete files from the Organizer when the program exits, if configured to do so. However, it may be necessary to delete a file manually. To do so, select a  presentation icon by single-clicking on it, and then press the delete <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/delete_file.png" alt="Trash Can image"/> button to delete the file and remove the icon from the Organizer. Since there is no <q>undo</q> feature, a confirmation dialog is presented to the user to provide a measure of escape prior to deleting any file.
</p>
<div>
	<img style="display: block; width: 55%; margin: 0 auto" alt="Delete File Confirmation Dialog image" src="../image/confirm_delete_dialog.png"/>
</div>
<p class="P5">
	If the <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/ok_button.png" alt="Green Checkbutton Image"/> button is pressed, the selected file is permanently deleted from the system, and the icon is removed from the Organizer. If the <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/cancel.png" alt="Red X Button"/> button is pressed, the delete operation is aborted, the presentation icon is retained and no files are deleted.
