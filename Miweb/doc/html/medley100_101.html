	This example combines two hymns, both are titled "Holy Ground" in the "Songs of Faith and Praise" hymnal, and their numbers are 100, and 101. It is important that both listboxes are <a href="arranger.html#CLEAR_ARRANGER">cleared</a> prior to creating a medley. This section illustrates the <a href="arranger.html#MEDLEY_OVERVIEW">Arranger outlined steps</a> to creating medley arrangements in general. The goal of this exercise is to present the two verses of #100 (it has no chorus), and include #101, which has no verse, to be the chorus, following each of the verses in #100. This is the order the hymn parts should appear in the final arrangement:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Verse 1 of Holy Ground by Beatty (#100)</li>
	<li>Chorus of Holy Ground by Davis (#101)</li>
	<li>1st Ending of Holy Ground by Davis (#101)</li>
	<li>Verse 2 of Holy Ground by Beatty (#100)</li>
	<li>Chorus of Holy Ground by Davis (#101)</li>
	<li>2nd Ending of Holy Ground by Davis (#101)</li>
</ul>
<p class="P5">
	It may appear to be a difficult or lengthy task, but this arrangement can be produced in about 30 seconds, once the steps are clearly understood. Note that there are several ways of creating this arrangement in the Media Center, which will be discussed briefly following the example.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="P3">
		(1) Double-click #100 in the Search Listbox.
	</span>
</p>

<img class="IMAGE" style="width:96%" src="../image/medley1.png"/>

<p class="P5">
	The result of selecting hymn #100 is that both Arranger listboxes are filled with the hymn's contents. Since a medley implies 2 or more hymns will be combined into a single arrangement, the other hymn is added to the Parts listbox.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="P3">
		(2) Double-click hymn #101 in the Search Listbox.
	</span>
</p>

<img class="IMAGE" style="width:96%" src="../image/medley2.png"/>
<p class="P5">
	Now there are 2 hymns in the Parts listbox (center of image above). This time, the parts from hymn #101 were not automatically added to the Arranger listbox (far right). The next step places the parts from #101 into the Arranger listbox.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="P3">
		(3) Select 'Chorus', '1st Ending', and '2nd Ending', and press <img class="ICON_IL" style="width:3%; margin-bottom:-5px;" src="../image/arranger_add.png" alt="Arranger Add"/>
	</span>
</p>

<img class="IMAGE" style="width:55%; float:right; padding:0in .4in .2in .2in" src="../image/medley3.png"/>
<p class="P5">
	<i>Almost</i> all of the parts are now in the Arranger box. However, the <a href="#GOAL">goal</a> is to include the 'Chorus' from #101 after <i>each</i> verse. So, we need to add that in a second time. Notice that all three parts are (still) selected in the Parts box after step 3 is completed. We need to select <i>only</i> the 'Chorus' from the Parts box, and add it to the Arranger.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="P3">
		(4) Click on each of the parts: '1st Ending' and '2nd Ending'. Then press <img class="ICON_IL" style="width:3%; margin-bottom:-5px;" src="../image/arranger_add.png" alt="Arranger Add"/>
	</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	<img class="IMAGE" style="width:55%; float:right; padding:0in .4in 0in .2in" src="../image/medley4.png"/>	Clicking a part in the Parts listbox will change its selection state. We now have all of the parts we need in the Arranger listbox to meet the <a href="#GOAL">goal</a> as illustrated in the figure at right. The parts are not in the desired order, which is what will be done next. These steps involve moving parts within the Arranger listbox so that they are in the same order as listed in the <a href="#GOAL">goal</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<span class="P3">
		(5) Click on 'Chorus' and drag it above 'Verse 2'. Repeat for '1st Ending' -- drag it above 'Verse 2'.
	</span>
</p>

<p class="P5">
	<img class="IMAGE" style="width:32%; float:left; padding:0in .2in 0in 0in" src="../image/medley5.png"/>
	The figure at left shows the two Arranger rows after they have moved. The <q>target</q> of the move was 'Verse 2'. A couple of general notes regarding row (part) selections in the listboxes might be helpful here. Selections are made within the Arranger list by single-clicking them. You can select multiple parts; each click adds the clicked part to the selection. To remove a part from the selection, simply click the selected part again in the Arranger. This will remove only the clicked part from the selection. The result of the move is shown highlighted. There remains only one more move to reach the <a href="#GOAL">goal</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="P3">
		(6) Select the last 'Chorus' and move it above '2nd Ending'
	</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	<img class="IMAGE" style="width:32%; float:left; padding:0in .2in .2in 0in" src="../image/medley6.png">
		The arrangement is complete. The change is again highlighted in the Arranger listbox image at left. The final step to creating the presentation file is no different from single hymns -- just press the <img style="height:auto; width:2.5%" src="../image/to_organizer_button.png" alt="Show In Organizer"> button located below the Arranger listbox to generate the presentation file and display the medley icon in the <a href="organizer.html">Organizer</a>. It will be obvious that there is a difference between the way single hymns are identified in the <a href="organizer.html">Organizer</a> from medlies. Medley icons do not contain the hymn titles, but rather the word "Medley" followed by the hymn numbers that comprise the medley. However, by hovering the mouse pointer over the medley icon, you can see the hymn titles with their respective book numbers in a tooltip widget. See the illustration below. 
</p>
<p>
	<span class="P3" id="GENERATE">
		(7) Generate the Presentation File <img class="ICON_IL" src="../image/to_organizer_button.png" alt="Arranger Add">
	</span>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	<img class="IMAGE" style="width:70%; float:right; padding:0in 0in 0in .2in" src="../image/medley7.png"/>
	Some final pointers may make things even easier as far as medley arrangements go. First, the order of the steps can be modified. For example,
	<ol>
		<li>Hymn #101 could have been selected first (double-clicked) prior to #100. This would have resulted in the 3 parts of #101 being put into the Arranger list in the first place.</li>
		<li>And we could have added the 2nd copy of the 'Chorus' from #101 immediately after.</li>
		<li>And then we could have double-clicked hymn #100 to add it to the Parts list,</li>
		<li>Selected it's two verses, and added them to the Arranger by clicking the <img style="width:16px" src="../image/arranger_add.png" alt="Arranger Add"> button.</li>
		<li>And finally, we could have moved the parts around in the Arranger to achieve the same goal.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p class="P5">
	Another time saver is to copy this medley file to another folder using a file manager window. When you want to use the medley again, copy it from its saved location and drop it into the hymns folder that the Media Center is configured to use (default is <Miweb>/presentations/other). Then restart the Media Center program, and it will find and display the medley icon in the <a href="organizer.html">Organizer</a>.
